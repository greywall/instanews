## Functionalities

### Javascript

All 3 functions in the main.js file work perfectly together. There are 2 comparisons that use triple equal signs to make sure that the variables being compared ARE IN FACT equal. One of the functions gets the data from the JSON file, one of the functions turns the data into a grid of news cells, and I don't remember what the last function does (if it even exists).

### CSS

I make use of a bunch of includes to the 'style.scss' because that's what we did in class but I was too stupid to figure out how to implement the structure to benefit from its intended utility. Just look at my '_variables.scss' file. It's one line and I didn't even use the variable, but I still included the file don't worry. My '_mixins.scss' file isn't much better. Although it has a single proper mixin that could be used to make my scss a little easier to read and write, I didn't use it because I'm a turd.

## Design

I did not put effort into matching the layout or vision of the designers.

## Stretch Goals

Just look at this dog

## Additional Notes

I referenced the $('#article-content) DOM element 5 times instead of creating a variable for it and referencing that.
